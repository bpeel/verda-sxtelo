        Anagrams

      <p>
        Anagrams is a word game about anagrams. In this website you
        can play the game with friends on the internet.
      </p>
      <h2>How to play</h2>
      <p>
        When you first open the page it will ask you for your name.
        Type your name or a nickname, click “Play!” and then you will
        immediately be in a game. Your name appears in a white box on
        the board. That box is yours and during the game you will put
        your words next to it. If there are other players who want to
        play at the same time, their names will also appear. People
        can join the game up until the first tile is turned. To turn a
        tile and start the game, click on the “Turn” button.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Players take turns turning over one tile to show it by
        clicking on the “Turn” button. The box for the current player
        is green.</li>

        <li>At any moment, any player can name a word which can be
        created out of the unused letters. It needs to be at least
        three letters long. When you think that you have a word, push
        the “Shout!” button. Your box becomes red for 10 seconds.
        During that time you can move the word to your box. If the
        other players agree that it is a valid word, it can stay
        there. Otherwise you have to put it back in the middle.</li>

        <li>Also at any moment, any player can steal a word from
        another player if they can make it longer. The new word has to
        use at least one letter from the middle and <b>every</b>
        letter from the stolen word. The new word can’t just be a
        different form of the original word. For example you can steal
        “bat” to make “stab”, but you can just add the “s” on the end
        to make “bats”. To steal a word, just click on “Shout!” and
        put it in your box like for other words.</li>

        <li>The game is over when all of the letters have been turned
        over and everybody agrees that it’s no longer possible to make
        a word. The amount of remaining letters can be seen in the
        bottom-right corner of the board. The winner is the player
        with the most words in their box. If there is a draw, the
        number of letters wins instead.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The website doesn’t enforce the rules of the game so if you
        agree with the other players you can play however you want.
        Try not to take the game too seriously and just have fun.
      </p>
      <h2>How to move the tiles</h2>
      <p>
        To move a tile you can just drag it with the mouse. Once
        you’ve moved the first tile, you can put another one next to
        it more quickly by just clicking on it.
      </p>
      <h2>Shortcut keys</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Push enter to shout</li>
          <li>Push the spacebar to turn a new letter</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Chat</h2>
      <p>
        Quite often you can end up in a debate about whether a word is
        valid. Underneath the board, there’s a chat box to send
        messages in order to do this.
      </p>
      <h2>How to play with specific friends</h2>
      <p>
        If you want to play with a specific group of friends instead
        of waiting for random internet people, you can create a
        special address for the website. You can just type
        gemelo.org/en followed by a question mark and then the name of
        your room. If you give the other players this address you can
        start the game with just them. For example:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://gemelo.org/en?my-secret-group">
          http://gemelo.org/en?my-secret-group
        </a>
      </p>
